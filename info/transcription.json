Most models, as is the one here, are language-dependant. You will need to select your desired language from the menu below before getting started. The output of the model provides a exact timestamp for where a word is spoken. Clicking on a word in the transcript will jump the video to the time stamp of when it predicts that word is being spoken.<\/p>",
