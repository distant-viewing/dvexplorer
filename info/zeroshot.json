{"short":"<p>Multimodal zero-shot learning extends and combines the ideas behind object detection and image embedding. The goal is to identify a similarity score between any pair of a textual description and an image such that the score is large when the description serves as a good caption for the image. This allows us to search for any categories (however complex) without having to create a specialized model for it. Here, we first run an embedding over the entire collection and then on the right allow for inputing a search string. We suggest starting with the large example datasets as the have pre-computed embeddings and quickly show the powerful possibilities of this approach.<\/p>","long":"<p>Multimodal zero-shot learning extends and combines the ideas behind object detection and image embedding.
