{"short":"<p>Shot boundary detection is the task of identifying where a video\ntransitions from one shot to another. Transitions can be a hard cut (the\nmost common type, showing a sudden break from one shot to the next) or a\ntransition shot such as a fade-in or cross-fade. The algorithm used in\nthe explorer is simple, taking the differences in pixels from one frame\nto the next. More accurate methods, which have not yet been ported to\nthe web, are shown in the Python code. Downloading the results will\nprovide a zip file with one frame from each shot. You can use these\nimages in any of the image-based annotations above.<\/p>","long":"<p>Shot boundary detection is the task of identifying where a video\ntransitions from one shot to another.
