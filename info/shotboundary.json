{"short":"<p>Shot boundary detection is the task of identifying where a video\ntransitions from one one shot to another. This can be a hard cut (the\nmost common type, showing a sudden break from one shot to the next) or a\ntransition shot such as a fade-in or cross-fade. The algorithm used in\nthe GUI is fairly simple, taking just the differences in pixels from one\nframe to the next. More accurate methods, which have not yet been ported\nto the web, are shown in the Python code. Downloading the results will\nprovide a zip file with one from frame from each shot. You can use these\nimages in any of the image-based annotations above.<\/p>","long":"<p>Shot boundary detection is the task of identifying where a video\ntransitions from one one shot to another.
