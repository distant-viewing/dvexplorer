{"short":"<p>Shot boundary detection is the task of identifying where a video transitions from one one shot to another. This can be a hard cut (the most common type, showing a sudden break from one shot to the next) or a transition shot such as a fade-in or cross-fade. The algorithm used in the GUI is fairly simple, taking just the differences in pixels from one frame to the next. More accurate methods, which have not yet been ported to the web, are shown in the Python code. Downloading the results will provide a zip file with one from frame from each shot. You can use these images in any of the image-based annotations above.<\/p>","long":"<p>Shot boundary detection is the task of identifying where a video transitions from one one shot to another.
