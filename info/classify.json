{"short":"<p>Image classification aims to identify a category from a pre-selected\nset describing an image. Outputs provide the top five most likely\ncategories predicted by the model, along with probability scores\nindicating the model’s confidence. Image classification is one of the\nearliest tasks in computer vision analysis, so it is a good place to\nstart. Try this with the ILSVRC example dataset, as it resembles the\ndata used to train these models more closely.<\/p>","long":"<p>Image classification aims to identify a category from a pre-selected\nset describing an image.
