{"short":"<p>The goal of image classfication is to identify a single category from\na pre-selected set that describes an image. Outputs provide the top five\nmost likely categories predicted by the model along with probability\nscores indicating the model’s confidence. Image classification is one of\nthe earliest tasks in computer vision analysis, so it is a good place to\nget started. Try this with the ILSVRC example dataset as it more closely\nresembles the kinds of data used to train these models.<\/p>","long":"<p>The goal of image classfication is to identify a single category from\na pre-selected set that describes an image.
